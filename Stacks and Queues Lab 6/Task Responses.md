**1. Use Figure 17 as a model to illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence PUSH(S, 4), PUSH(S, 1), PUSHS, 3), POP(S), PUSH(S, 8), POP(S) on an initially empty stack S stored in array S[1..6].**



**2. Use Figure 18 as a model to illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence ENQUEUE(Q, 4), ENQUEUE(Q, 1), ENQUEUE(Q, 3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q, 8), DEQUEUE(S) on an initially empty queue Q stored in array Q[1..6].**



**3. Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect _underflow_ and _overflow_ of a queue**



**4. A stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only end, a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, and a deque (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four _O(1)_-time procedures to insert elements into and and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array**
