**1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]?**



**2. How many steps would a binary search take for the previous example?**



**3. What is the maxiumum numbers of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array size of 100,000?**



**4. Write C++ code that implements the linear and binary search algorithms. The algorithm should be able to calculate the number of stepse against the given search.**
