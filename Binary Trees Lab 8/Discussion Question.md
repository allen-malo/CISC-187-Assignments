**Share some real-world examples of the Binary Search Tree algorithm. Cite your references.**

Before we get into some real world examples, it is important to know how binary search trees work. Binary search trees are made up of nodes, and each node contains a value (the data you are storing in the structure), a left node, and a right node. The left node will lead to a node that contains a value less than the value in the parent node, while the right node will contain the opposite (so greater values -> right, smaller values -> left). This allows them to provide an average Big-O time complexity of O(log(N)), where N is the number of nodes in the array (much faster than a linear search).

In terms of real-world applications, binary search trees have many uses. For example, a user on Stack Overflow mentions that they are used in countless search applications where it is crucial to efficiently manage and order data that constantly enters/leaves, such as maps and sets in many languages' libraries. Google's AI overview expands upon this, and mentions that when inserting a new key-value pair, the tree will be traversed based on the key's value. This ensures that the properties of the binary search tree (lesser values on the left, greater ones on the right) is maintained effectively. Then, when it comes time to search the tree for a value, the traversal of the tree becomes very similar to that of when the key-value pair was originally inserted. A great example of this is in Java in the TreeMap data structure, which uses the same algorithm that a binary search tree uses to search for items (lesser ones -> left, greater ones -> right).
